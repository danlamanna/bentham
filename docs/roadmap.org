* Usecases
** Twitter
** Github
*** Personal
*** Repository
*** Other Users
** RSS Feeds
** System Logs
** Email
+ do we want to store a whole email?

** One-off events
e.g., =bentham message foo=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
if [ $0 -ne "foo" ]; then
  bentham message 'foo'
fi
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$> long_process.sh && bentham message "finished"
#+END_SRC




** Calendar
*** Google
*** Exchange (?)


* Database Schema
** events (tables)
*** id (int, primary_key)
*** created_at (timestamp)
+ When was it inserted into postgres
*** occured_at (timestamp)
+ Timestamp from the actual event
*** tracker (string)
+ celery task that ran
+ e.g., 'bentham.trackers.github_events'
*** source (string)
+ human readable identifier
+ (tracker, source) should be unique for the system (not the database)
*** message (string)
+ friendly string you want to display
+ would like to be able to support something like
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  "{username} - Tweted at {timestamp}".format(raw_json)
  #+END_SRC

*** raw_event (blob)
*** raw_event_json (json)
*** read (bool)
+ Whether or not I have seen it (approximately) 




* Database Migration (?)
** peewee migrations


* Command Line Management

* Configuration Management

* Deployment
** Daemon Process (Celery Beat)
** Development Environment?
** Postgres
** RabbitMQ
** Celery Worker


* Future Improvements
** Score of importance
** Some kind of tags table?
+ create groups of trackers etc "channels"
